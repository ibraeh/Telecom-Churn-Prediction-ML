# Project Title
Telecom Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms

# Description 
Customer churn is a significant challenge in the telecom industry, where customers can easily switch providers. Predicting churn allows companies to proactively target at-risk customers with retention campaigns, minimizing revenue loss. This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms in predicting customer churn using a dataset obtained from Kaggle

This project investigates the following questions:

What factors contribute to customer churn in the telecom industry?
How accurately can different machine learning algorithms predict customer churn based on these factors?

# Methodology
## Data Acquisition
The data for this project was obtained from the [Telecom Customer Churn Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shilongzhuang/telecom-customer-churn-by-maven-analytics) dataset. This dataset includes information on various customer demographics, service plans, and usage patterns, along with a label indicating whether a customer churned (cancelled service) or not.

## Data Exploration & Preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We performed an initial exploration of the data to understand its characteristics, identify potential missing values, and analyze the distribution of key features.
* Data Cleaning: We addressed missing values through techniques like mean/median imputation or removal depending on the feature's nature. Categorical features were encoded using appropriate methods (e.g., one-hot encoding).
* Feature Engineering (Optional): If you created any new features based on existing ones, briefly describe the process here.

## Machine Learning Models
We experimented with a variety of machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn. Here's a breakdown of the chosen models and the rationale behind them:

* Logistic Regression: A widely used linear model suitable for classification problems. It provides interpretability of the model's predictions, allowing us to understand which factors most influence churn.
* Random Forest: An ensemble learning method known for its robustness to overfitting and handling complex relationships between features.
* Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost): Another powerful ensemble method that can capture non-linear relationships and potentially outperform simpler models in churn prediction.
(Optional): Briefly mention any hyperparameter tuning techniques used to optimize the performance of each model.

# Evaluation
To assess the effectiveness of the chosen machine learning models in predicting customer churn, we employed several evaluation metrics:

* Accuracy: Measures the overall proportion of correctly classified churn and non-churn customers.
* Precision: Represents the proportion of predicted churn cases that were actually churned (avoiding false positives).
* Recall: Captures the proportion of actual churn cases that were correctly identified by the model (avoiding false negatives).
* AUC-ROC Curve: A visualization tool that helps compare the performance of different models. It plots the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at various classification thresholds. A model with a higher AUC-ROC value generally performs better.
We evaluated each model using these metrics on a held-out test set (a portion of the data not used for training) to ensure unbiased assessment. The results will be presented in tables or charts within this section.

Key Findings:

Based on the evaluation results, we will identify the most effective machine learning algorithms for predicting customer churn in this dataset. The analysis will highlight:

Which models achieved the highest accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC score.
Insights into the trade-offs between different metrics (e.g., a model with high accuracy might have lower precision).
